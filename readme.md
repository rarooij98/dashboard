### Dataset Column Information

Here is a breakdown of the columns in the 'Laadpaaldata' dataset:

1. **Started:** 
   - Description: The date and time when the event started.
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

2. **Ended:** 
   - Description: The date and time when the event ended.
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

3. **TotalEnergy:** 
   - Description: The total energy consumption during the event (in some units).
   - Example: 1830

4. **ConnectedTime:** 
   - Description: The duration of the event while the device was connected (in hours).
   - Example: 0.5219

5. **ChargeTime:** 
   - Description: The duration of the event while the device was charging (in hours).
   - Example: 0.5219

6. **MaxPower:** 
   - Description: The maximum power consumption during the event (in watts).
   - Example: 3524

### Column Explanations

- **Started** and **Ended** columns provide the timestamp for when each event started and ended, allowing you to track the duration of each event.

- **TotalEnergy** indicates the total energy consumed during the event, providing insight into energy usage.

- **ConnectedTime** represents the time the device was actively connected during the event, which may be useful for analyzing usage patterns.

- **ChargeTime** specifies the time the device spent charging, which can be important for understanding how much time the device spent replenishing its power.

- **MaxPower** reveals the maximum power consumption observed during the event, which can be valuable for assessing peak power demands.
